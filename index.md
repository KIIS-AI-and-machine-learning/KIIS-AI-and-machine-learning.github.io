#### Day 1 class

- Introductions and logistics
  - Who is in this class?
  - Overview of the course
  - [Google classroom site](https://classroom.google.com/c/NjI5OTgzMTIxNjY0?cjc=rpt2rpgv). Please add yourself to the classroom.
  - [Course Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQQXr5bMYzmBOjtXHsAXmbZOZL8kW23T/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103905169133625663429&rtpof=true&sd=true)
  - Go to the [AI and ML Fieldpad](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LhSdMsdJ1YXdxZiB7pcRdu_l_vcpZkLa?usp=sharing) and request access to your own fieldpad. This is where you will record your in-class and homework reflections.
  - [Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/), and [Building AI](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/). Note that we will be using this **in class**, so please do not work ahead.

- Some questions to keep in mind today and throughout the course:
  - What is AI? What about generative AI?
  - How is Taiwan involved in AI?
  - What is Machine Learning?
  - What is Deep Learning?
  - What Generative AI tools are useful for various tasks?

#### Day 1: Field Work

- Read [The Impact of AI on Computer Science Education](https://cacm.acm.org/news/the-impact-of-ai-on-computer-science-education/)
  - **Prompt 1**: What are the key takeaways from this article? How have you used generative AI in the past in your learning process? Do you think you have used in ways that enhance rather than hinder your learning? Explain.

- AI might not be as far along today if it were not for Taiwan's chip industry.
- Read [Taiwan’s new 2nm chip set to power the AI revolution](https://asiatimes.com/2025/04/taiwans-new-2nm-chip-set-to-power-the-ai-revolution/), [Can the U.S. Outpace China in AI and Stop a Chip War Over Taiwan? Experts Clash Over the High-Stakes Semiconductor Race](https://opentodebate.org/news_article/can-the-u-s-outpace-china-in-ai-and-stop-a-chip-war-over-taiwan-experts-clash-over-the-high-stakes-semiconductor-race/), and [Will Trump tip the AI race in China’s favor?](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2025/06/01/2003837840)
  - **Prompt 2**: What are the key takeaways from these articles? Explain.

- Read [Elements of AI: 1.1 How should we define AI?](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/1) and discuss the questions in your group before having them graded.
  - **Prompt 3**: What is your own definition of AI? Does it differ from the definitions in the article? Explain.

- **Post-class reflection:** *Remember that the Post-class reflection should be a summary reflection on the course material learned that day. It should be formally written with yourself, your classmates and your professor as the audience.* Reflect on the day’s activities and discussions in your Fieldpad. What did you learn? Explain.

#### Day 1 Homework

1. Go to [01 Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118/course_templates/536) and complete the microcourse by watching the video, exploring some additional resources, and taking the quiz. You will get a badge!
2. Go to [Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/tree/main/01-introduction-to-genai) and either watch the video or read the lesson.
3. Read [How to Use AI Without Forgetting Everything You Learned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-we-remember/202506/how-to-use-ai-without-forgetting-everything-you-learned)
4. After watching these videos and doing the reading, use your favorite generative AI tool to further explore at least one idea further.Discuss what you chose and why and be sure to link and reference your chat as described in the syllabus in your Fieldpad.
5. Discuss what you learned from this homework in your own words in your Fieldpad.

**Homework Reflections:**
(Note that unless otherwise stated, all homework is due at 8 am on the day of the next class session.) Use the Cybersecurity Field Pad to record your in-class reflections.

- Read [Why war with China over Taiwan could ruin the global economy](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-war-china-us-ruin-global-economy-semiconductors-chips-rcna91321). Note that this article is from 2023, and the situation has changed since then, but it is still a good overview of the issues.
- Read [Nvidia to Build AI Supercomputer and New HQ in Taiwan](https://decrypt.co/320840/nvidia-to-build-ai-supercomputer-and-new-hq-in-taiwan)
- Read [Can the U.S. Outpace China in AI and Stop a Chip War Over Taiwan? Experts Clash Over the High-Stakes Semiconductor Race](https://opentodebate.org/news_article/can-the-u-s-outpace-china-in-ai-and-stop-a-chip-war-over-taiwan-experts-clash-over-the-high-stakes-semiconductor-race/)

1. What are the most important things you learned about the course topics from the homework? Explain.
2. How have you used generative AI in the past in your learning process? Do you think you have used in ways that enhance rather than hinder your learning? Explain.
3. Over this course's duration, I will be challenging you to learn to use generative AI in new ways and to analyze your own learning using metacognition.

### In addition to the normal stuff, be sure to pack all of the following in your carry-on bag (not your checked luggage.)

- your laptop and charger
- earphones to use with your laptop
