## Day 2: June 6 2025, 10:30-12:30, Room J316

### Day 2 Theme: AI and Related Fields

#### Day 2 class

- I am hoping to give you feedback on your Fieldpad by Monday.
- Discuss homework from Day 1:
  - How much time did you spend on the homework?
  - How did you define AI?
  - What did you learn from the homework?

- If you do not already have one, make an account on [Runestone Academy](https://runestone.academy/) and add the book **KIIS_AI_2025**. We will use this for Peer Instruction.
  - Go to [PI from Day 1](https://runestone.academy/runestone/peer/peer_question?assignment_id=222668).

#### Day 2: Field Work

- Watch [Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence: Crash Course Computer Science #34](https://youtu.be/z-EtmaFJieY?feature=shared).
  - **Prompt 1**: While watching the video, take notes on the AI and ML terms that are introduced, so you can look them up afterwards. Which terms did you note?

- Watch [The Turing test: Can a computer pass for a human? ](https://youtu.be/3wLqsRLvV-c?feature=shared)
  - **Prompt 2**: What are your thoughts on the Turing test? Do you think it is a good measure of AI? Why or why not? Explain.

- Working with your partner (s), return to the Elements of AI textbook and discuss the questions in [Elements of AI: 1.1 How should we define AI?](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/1), When you reach consensus, go ahead and have the questions graded.

- After finishing section, work through the rest of chapter 1, stopping each time you reach a question. Discuss the questions in your group, and when you reach consensus, have the questions graded.
  - **Prompt 2**: Is this technique of working in groups to answer questions useful to you? Why or why not? Explain.

- **Post-class reflection:** *Remember that the Post-class reflection should be a summary reflection on the course material learned that day. It should be formally written with yourself, your classmates and your professor as the audience.* Reflect on the day’s activities and discussions in your Fieldpad. What did you learn? Explain.

#### Day 2 Homework

1. Watch [Introduction to Large Language Models: Video](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118/course_templates/539/video/518194)
2. Explore some additional reading from [Introduction to Large Language Models: Readings](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118/course_templates/539/documents/518195)
3. Take [Introduction to Large Language Models: Quiz](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118/course_templates/539/quizzes/518196), getting at least 80% correct.
4. Read [I tried 70+ best AI tools in 2025](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools), and then choose 2 or 3 of these AI tools that you have never used before and give them a try. Write a short description of each of these three tools, why you chose it, and how well it did what you asked it to do, and whether you might use it again in the future. Save and link to each chat if the tool allows it.
5. Discuss what you learned from this homework in your own words in your Fieldpad.

## Day 1: June 5 2025, 10:30-12:30, Room J417

### Day 1 Theme: Class Overview - What is AI?

#### Day 1 class

- Introductions and logistics:
  - Who is in this class?
  - Overview of the course
  - [Google classroom site](https://classroom.google.com/c/NzgxNjQwNjEzNDAz?cjc=5i5bapjb). Please add yourself to the classroom.
  - [Course Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Hk38t7jdIZX3btouNdg3vToB1pcWL7s/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103905169133625663429&rtpof=true&sd=true)
  - Go to the [AI and ML Fieldpad](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LhSdMsdJ1YXdxZiB7pcRdu_l_vcpZkLa?usp=sharing) and request access to your own fieldpad. This is where you will record your in-class and homework reflections.
  - [Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/), and [Building AI](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/). Note that we will be using this **in class**, so please do not work ahead.
  - KIIS takes pride in high academic standards, but also requires that all courses be prerequisite-free. KIIS strongly encourages a *Place-As-Text* approach, which helps students learn content via international context.

- Some questions to keep in mind today and throughout the course:
  - What is AI? What about generative AI?
  - How is Taiwan involved in AI?
  - What is Machine Learning?
  - What is Deep Learning?
  - What Generative AI tools are useful for various tasks?

#### Day 1: Field Work

- Read the first section of [The Impact of AI on Computer Science Education](https://cacm.acm.org/news/the-impact-of-ai-on-computer-science-education/)
  - **Prompt 1**: What are the key takeaways from this article? How have you used generative AI in the past in your learning process? Do you think you have used in ways that enhance rather than hinder your learning? Explain.

- AI might not be as far along today if it were not for Taiwan's chip industry. Skim all of the following:
    - [Why war with China over Taiwan could ruin the global economy](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-war-china-us-ruin-global-economy-semiconductors-chips-rcna91321). Note that this article is from 2023, and the situation has changed since then, but it is still a good overview of the issues.
  - [Taiwan’s new 2nm chip set to power the AI revolution](https://asiatimes.com/2025/04/taiwans-new-2nm-chip-set-to-power-the-ai-revolution/), 
  - [Can the U.S. Outpace China in AI and Stop a Chip War Over Taiwan? Experts Clash Over the High-Stakes Semiconductor Race](https://opentodebate.org/news_article/can-the-u-s-outpace-china-in-ai-and-stop-a-chip-war-over-taiwan-experts-clash-over-the-high-stakes-semiconductor-race/),
  - and [Will Trump tip the AI race in China’s favor?](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2025/06/01/2003837840)
  - After reading all of the above, respond to **Prompt 2**: What are the key takeaways you learned from these four articles? Explain.

- Read as far as you can in [Elements of AI: 1.1 How should we define AI?](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/1) and discuss the questions in your group before having them graded. **Please remember not to work ahead in this text. We will continue in the text next time.**
  - Regardless of how far you got in your reading, answer **Prompt 3**: What is your own definition of AI? Explain.

- **Post-class reflection:** *Remember that the Post-class reflection should be a summary reflection on the course material learned that day. It should be formally written with yourself, your classmates and your professor as the audience.* Reflect on the day’s activities and discussions in your Fieldpad. What did you learn? Explain.

#### Day 1 Homework

1. Finish the reading of  [Elements of AI: 1.1 How should we define AI?](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/1) only up to the first question. Do not answer the questions. We will complete this next time.
2. Go to [01 Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118/course_templates/536) and complete the microcourse by watching the video, exploring some additional resources, and taking the quiz. You will get a badge!
3. Go to [Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/tree/main/01-introduction-to-genai) and either watch the video or read the lesson.
4. Read [How to Use AI Without Forgetting Everything You Learned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-we-remember/202506/how-to-use-ai-without-forgetting-everything-you-learned). Note that over this course's duration, I will be challenging you to learn to use generative AI in new ways and to analyze your own learning using metacognition.
5. After watching these videos and doing the reading, use your favorite generative AI tool to further explore at least one idea further. Discuss what you chose and why and be sure to link and reference your chat as described in the syllabus in your Fieldpad.
6. Discuss what you learned from this homework in your own words in your Fieldpad.

**Homework Reflections:**
(Note that unless otherwise stated, all homework is due at 8 am on the day of the next class session.) Use the AI and Machine Learning Field Pad to record your in-class reflections.

### In addition to the normal stuff, be sure to pack all of the following in your carry-on bag (not your checked luggage.)

- your laptop and charger
- earphones to use with your laptop
