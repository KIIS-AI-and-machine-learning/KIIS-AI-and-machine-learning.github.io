# AI/ML Final Project Proposal

## Project Overview

Working in teams of 2-3 students, you will create an educational Google Colab notebook that explores an AI or machine learning topic in depth. Your notebook should both **explain the concept clearly** and **demonstrate it with working code**.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Deepen your understanding of a specific AI/ML concept
- Practice explaining technical concepts to others
- Gain hands-on experience implementing AI algorithms
- Create a resource that others can learn from

## Project

### 1. Topic Selection
Choose an AI or ML topic that interests your team. You may:
- **Expand on a topic from Building AI textbook** o
- **Explore a new AI application** not covered in our course 

### 2. Deliverable Format
Create a Google Colab notebook that includes:
- **Educational content** (markdown cells explaining concepts)
- **Interactive demonstrations** (code cells with implementations)
- **Real-world applications** and examples
- **Ethical considerations** related to your topic

### 3. Technical Requirements
Your notebook should:
- Be **self-contained** (all necessary imports and setup included)
- Include **clear explanations** suitable for your classmates
- Demonstrate the AI/ML concept with **practical examples** with **working code** that others can run successfully

### 4. Demonstration of your project on Monday, June 23, out last day of class.
- an informal demonstration of your notework
- sharing of the link so the class can try it out
- question and answers

## Suggested Topics

### From Building AI Textbook:
- **Search Algorithms** (Chapter 2): Implement A* search or compare different pathfinding algorithms
- **Optimization** (Chapter 3): Explore genetic algorithms or simulated annealing
- **Neural Networks** (Chapter 4): Build a simple neural network from scratch
- **Machine Learning** (Chapter 5): Compare supervised vs unsupervised learning approaches
- **Implications** (Chapter 6): AI bias detection and mitigation techniques

### Additional AI/ML Topics:
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, or face recognition
- **Natural Language Processing**: Sentiment analysis, text generation, or language translation
- **Recommendation Systems**: Movie/music recommendations using collaborative filtering
- **Time Series Analysis**: Stock price prediction or weather forecasting
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Game-playing AI or autonomous agents
- **Clustering**: Customer segmentation or data pattern discovery
- **AI in Healthcare**: Medical image analysis or drug discovery
- **AI in Finance**: Fraud detection or algorithmic trading
- **AI Ethics**: Fairness testing or bias detection in AI systems

## Proposal Format

Submit a link to a **1 page proposal** in Google Colab that includes:

### Team Information
- **Team members names**
- **A team name**

### Project Description
- **Topic chosen** and a brief explanation of the topic itself.
- **Why this topic interests your team** (personal connection, career relevance, curiosity, etc.)
- **What specific aspect** you plan to focus on
- **Key concepts** you plan to explain and demonstrate

### Learning Goals
- **What you hope to learn** from this project
- **What you want others to learn** from your notebook
- **How this connects** to your academic or career interests
